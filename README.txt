SIMPLE META KEYWORDS WORDPRESS PLUGIN

This simple plugin will take any tags assigned to a post and enter them 
into the "keywords" meta tag. This *ONLY* happens on the single post page,
and not any archive pages. Just the single post. That's it.

There is a way to specify default keywords to appear on all other pages 
(archives, search, index, etc.) and on single posts where no tags are 
specified.

See INSTALL.txt for installation instructions.

This plugin was written for my weblog The Tools Artists Use, located at
http://thetoolsartistsuse.com/ if you'd like to see it in action. Just 
view the source on the single post archives.
