SIMPLE META KEYWORDS WORDPRESS PLUGIN

This simple plugin will take any tags assigned to a post and enter them 
into the "keywords" meta tag. This *ONLY* happens on the single post page,
and not any archive pages. Just the single post. That's it.

There is a way to specify default keywords to appear on all other pages 
(archives, search, index, etc.) and on single posts where no tags are 
specified.

See INSTALL.txt for installation instructions.
