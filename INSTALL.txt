SIMPLE META KEYWORDS WORDPRESS PLUGIN INSTRUCTIONS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Open up the simple-meta-keywords.php file in a text editor of your 
   choice.
   
2. Find the line that looks like this:

   $default_keywords = "weblog,interesting,neat,super,duper";
   
   Remove those five sample keywords, and put in your own default
   keywords (unless you want to keep those of course). The only rules
   for the default keyword list are:
   
   a) separate the keywords with commas

   b) do not leave any spaces around the commas
   
   Basically, you want it to look just like the example in the code.

3. Put the simple-meta-keywords.php file in your wp-content/plugins/ 
   directory, via upload or whatever you normally do.

4. On the WP Dashboard Plugins screen, activate the plugin.

5. That should be it!


CAVEATS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

If your current theme, or another plugin, also tries to add the keywords
meta tag, I'm not sure what will happen; but probably nothing good.

This code is released as is. I may make adjustments over time to this
plugin, but right now it does exactly what I need.

I can't provide tech support if this plugin isn't working for you.
